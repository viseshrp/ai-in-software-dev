# Summary Guide (Phase 1)

Goal: capture signal, preserve traceability, and separate *author claims* from *your interpretation*.

## Rules

- Don’t add facts not present in the article.
- Prefer paraphrase over quoting; if a quote is essential, keep it short.
- Attribute: if it’s the author’s claim, keep it in the “per the author” sections.
- Keep “Notes (your interpretation)” clearly labeled as your own.

## What to extract

- Core ideas: the main points the author is trying to convey.
- What works: practices/tools/workflows the author reports as effective.
- Limitations/risks: caveats, failure modes, costs, organizational issues.
- Claims worth validating: metrics, sweeping statements, predictions, “X% improvement”, etc.

## When details are missing

- If the author implies something but doesn’t specify it, write the uncertainty explicitly (“unclear whether…”, “no baseline provided…”).
