# Plan: Research → Distill → Synthesize → Slide Deck

## Objective

We are building a structured understanding of how AI is changing software development (2023–2026).

The goal is:
- Personal clarity
- Helping other developers gain clarity
- Separating what is real from what is overhyped
- Identifying what actually works in practice
- Showing what developers are missing if they ignore this shift

This is not a hype deck.
This is a field report grounded in real experimentation and real-world writing.

# Phase 1 — Blog Capture

We will collect blog posts and articles about:
- Agentic AI
- AI-assisted development
- Productivity claims
- Market reactions
- Corporate expectations
- Limitations and risks
- Personal experiments
- and many more

For each blog post:

1. Create a markdown file.
2. Extract the core ideas in structured bullet form.
3. Include a link to the original source at the bottom.
4. Preserve signal. Avoid fluff.
5. Do not hallucinate content not present in the article.

All files must remain markdown for AI-friendly processing.

---

# Phase 2 — Normalize & Improve

After multiple blog posts are summarized:

- Review summaries for clarity and consistency.
- Remove duplication.
- Identify recurring patterns.
- Identify contradictions.
- Highlight claims that appear repeatedly.
- Surface claims that lack evidence.

Do not impose rigid categories prematurely.
Let themes emerge from the data.

# Phase 3 — Synthesis

After the repository contains many summarized articles:

1. Analyze across all files.
2. Identify major recurring themes.
3. Identify disagreements in the ecosystem.
4. Separate:
   - What’s actually happening
   - What works in practice
   - What doesn’t
   - What’s overhyped
   - What developers are missing

This synthesis should reference source files.

# Phase 4 — Narrative Formation

Build a clear narrative structure for a presentation:

The tone should be:
- Grounded
- Practical
- Evidence-based
- Developer-focused
- Not sensational

It should feel like:
“Here’s what’s actually happening. Here’s what works. Here’s what doesn’t. Here’s what’s overhyped. Here’s what you’re missing if you ignore it.”

---

# Phase 5 — Slide Generation

Once synthesis is stable:

- Prepare a condensed version suitable for slide generation.
- Maintain clarity over volume.
- Preserve nuance.
- Avoid generic AI optimism.

Slides will later be generated from this distilled repository.

---

# Constraints

- Use version control for all changes.
- Keep changes incremental.
- Avoid hallucinating missing facts.
- Prioritize clarity over comprehensiveness.
- Preserve original links for traceability.
- Allow themes to emerge organically.

---

End Goal:

A clean, evolving knowledge base that allows us to:
- Think clearly
- Track ecosystem progress
- Teach other developers
- Avoid hype
- Avoid missing important shifts
