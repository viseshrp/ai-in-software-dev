# Synthesis Guide (Phases 2–4)

This repo is designed to support bottom-up synthesis after enough sources are captured.

## Normalization (Phase 2)

- Remove duplication across summaries by tightening wording, not by deleting nuance.
- Track recurring claims and *what evidence is actually provided*.
- Flag contradictions explicitly; don’t “average” them away.

## Synthesis (Phase 3)

Cross-cutting questions to answer using the captured summaries:

- What patterns repeat across sources (tools, workflows, org changes)?
- Where do credible sources disagree?
- Which claims show evidence vs. vibes?
- What breaks in practice (latency, context limits, security, evals, incentives)?

## Narrative (Phase 4)

Aim for a developer-facing structure:

- What’s actually happening (observable)
- What works (repeatable practices)
- What doesn’t (anti-patterns)
- What’s overhyped (unsupported claims)
- What developers miss if they ignore this shift (consequences, skill gaps)

This narrative can feed derivative artifacts (posts, talks, slide decks), but research/synthesis is the primary goal.
