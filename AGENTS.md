# Agent Instructions (ai-in-software-dev)

Use this repo to build a grounded, markdown-first field report on how AI is changing software development (2023–2026).

## Ground rules

- Don’t hallucinate: only summarize what a source actually says; label interpretation separately.
- Preserve traceability: every summary must include the original `source_url`.
- Keep changes incremental and commit-friendly (prefer one source per commit plus updated `INDEX.md`).
- Let themes emerge; don’t impose rigid taxonomies too early.
- Treat slides/presentations as optional outputs derived from research (not the primary goal).

## Canonical project brief

- See `/Users/vp-dc/Documents/GitHub/ai-in-software-dev/docs/PROJECT_PROMPT.md:1` for the full plan (phases, constraints, end goal).

## Seed context (non-authoritative)

- Read `/Users/vp-dc/Documents/GitHub/ai-in-software-dev/SEED.md:1` before starting work.
- Treat it as raw initial research and thinking, not a finalized structure or “source of truth”.
- You are expected to refine, question, and evolve it over time.

## Key repo docs

- Summary guidance: `/Users/vp-dc/Documents/GitHub/ai-in-software-dev/docs/SUMMARY_GUIDE.md:1`
- Synthesis guidance: `/Users/vp-dc/Documents/GitHub/ai-in-software-dev/docs/SYNTHESIS_GUIDE.md:1`
- Seed distillation map: `/Users/vp-dc/Documents/GitHub/ai-in-software-dev/docs/SEED_MAP.md:1`
- Workflow: `/Users/vp-dc/Documents/GitHub/ai-in-software-dev/CONTRIBUTING.md:1`

## Required behavior (always)

Maintain a running log in `/Users/vp-dc/Documents/GitHub/ai-in-software-dev/AGENT_LOG.md:1`.

For every task/blog processed, log:
- What you did
- Files created/modified
- Decisions made (and why)
- Assumptions
- Commands run (if any)
- Test results (if relevant)
- Open questions / ambiguities
- Areas needing clarification
- Improvements to your own workflow
