# Agent Instructions (ai-in-software-dev)

Use this repo to build a grounded, markdown-first field report on how AI is changing software development (2023–2026).

## Ground rules

- Don’t hallucinate: only summarize what a source actually says; label interpretation separately.
- Preserve traceability: every summary must include the original `source_url`.
- Keep changes incremental and commit-friendly (prefer one source per commit plus updated `INDEX.md`).
- Let themes emerge; don’t impose rigid taxonomies too early.

## Canonical project brief

- See `/Users/vp-dc/Documents/GitHub/ai-in-software-dev/docs/PROJECT_PROMPT.md:1` for the full plan (phases, constraints, end goal).
